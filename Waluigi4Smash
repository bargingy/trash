<h1>Waluigi For Smash</h1>
<p>Surely, if you haven't been living under a rock, you'd have heard about Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. During an update video for the game, Nintendo showed off that most Assist Trophies can be knocked out. The Trophy they decided to use to demonstrate this was Waluigi, I'm not saying that Nintendo hates Waluigi, in fact I very highly doubt so. But fans of Waluigi, or at least some of them weren't too happy with their favorite character's confirmation for being in the game not only proved that Waluigi was an Assist Trophy, but showed him being harmed. Now, I'm a Waluigi fan, but I wasn't outraged at either of these things, maybe sad that he still wasn't going to be a fighter, but otherwise quiet about it. Worst case scenario: Waluigi was going to remain an Assist Trophy-Best case scenario: It was a huge jape put on by Sakurai to fool people on Waluigi making an appearance as a survivor to surprise everyone. <p>

<p>Now, I'm sure any fan of a character that's an Assist Trophy wouldn't be too pleased at their character being beat up in a trailer (even though the game is Super Smash Bros, a game where you have to beat eachother up, but some Waluigi fans got vocal, giving their two cents on the ,tter on Twitter, Reddit, etc.
