<h1> Waluigi For Smash</h1>
<p> Surely, if you haven't been living under a rock, you'd have heard about Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. During an update video for the game, Nintendo showed off that most Assist Trophies can be knocked out. The Trophy they decided to use to demonstrate this was Waluigi, I'm not saying that Nintendo hates Waluigi, in fact I very highly doubt so. But fans of Waluigi, or at least some of them weren't too happy with their favorite character's confirmation for being in the game not only proved that Waluigi was an Assist Trophy, but showed him being harmed. Now, I'm a Waluigi fan, but I wasn't outraged at either of these things, maybe sad that he still wasn't going to be a fighter, but otherwise quiet about it. Worst case scenario: Waluigi was going to remain an Assist Trophy-Best case scenario: It was a huge jape put on by Sakurai to fool people on Waluigi making an appearance as a survivor to surprise everyone. <p>

<p> Now, I'm sure any fan of a character that's an Assist Trophy wouldn't be too pleased at their character being beat up in a trailer (even though the game is Super Smash Bros, a game where you have to beat eachother up,) but some Waluigi fans got vocal, giving their two cents on the matter on Twitter, Reddit, and other social media. <p>

                                                                                    

<p> Now, there were and still are 6 types of people who were making posts about Waluigi getting in Smash. <p>

<ul>
  <li>Mature, civilised fans of Waluigi that were respecting of other character's fans' speculation and opinions.</li>
  <li>Childish fans of Waluigi that usually commented rude things such as insults and death threats to fans of other characters</li>
  <li>People who didn't really care about Waluigi, and just were in it for the meme.</li>
  <li>Respectful fans of other characters that made posts on their opinion of Waluigi getting in, stating reasons they think he won't get in, and participating in civilised arguments about such.</li>
  <li>Fans of other characters that were basically the opposite of the above.</li>
  <li>And finally, those who had no opinion on Waluigi, but were saying he'd most likely make it to DLC.</li>
</ul>

<p> Now,  if you have kept up with the news on this matter, you've probably heard about fans of Waluigi sending death threats to Sakurai. Now, you may not have heard the truth about this. You see, there were only around two legitimate Waluigi fans that sent Death Threats to Sakurai, and they actually apologised for doing so. Now
